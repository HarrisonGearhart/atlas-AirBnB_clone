    Class for storing and retrieving data

        __objects: dictionary - empty but will store all objects
        by <class name>.id

        new(self, obj): sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id

        reload(self): deserializes the JSON file to __objects
        (only if the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do nothing.
